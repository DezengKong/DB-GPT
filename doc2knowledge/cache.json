summary\\nthe document discusses a high cpu usage issue in the yyyyy system, which was discovered during an inspection. the high cpu usage was attributed to the different cpu monitoring methods between gauss 300 and yyyyy, and a specific sql query that was causing excessive row scans. the document suggests a solution to optimize the sql query by modifying it to avoid using the to_timestamp function and adjusting the jdbc interface. the document also provides a detailed analysis of the cpu usage patterns and the performance baseline report.\\n\\n1.3 - procedure\\nthe document discusses the process of analyzing and optimizing sql queries in a database. it starts by examining the cpu usage curve, noting that the cpu usage is high (80%-90%) after midnight. the document then compares the cpu usage during normal and high periods using wdr reports. it identifies a specific sql query that consumes significantly more cpu and executes three times more often during high cpu usage periods. the document then provides detailed execution information for this query, including start and finish times, execution plan, and various performance metrics. finally, the document suggests an optimization strategy to reduce the number of partition scans, thus lowering cpu consumption and speeding up sql execution. this involves modifying the query to use constants, which supports partition pruning.\\n\\n1.4 - root_cause\\nthe document discusses the root cause of high cpu usage after switching to yyyyy. it attributes the issue to two factors: the cpu monitoring implementation in yyyyy, which includes user/system/nice/iowait metrics, and the high execution frequency and cpu usage of a specific sql statement. the sql statement in question is provided in the document.\\n\\n1.5 - solution\\nthe document provides a solution for optimizing a sql query that is causing high cpu consumption due to scanning 40 partitions at once. the proposed solution suggests modifying the sql call method to use constants in the expression and assign values through the corresponding jdbc api interface. this will leverage the kernel's current partition table pruning ability, reducing partition scanning and lowering cpu consumption. it is recommended that customers test this solution in a test environment before deploying it to production to fully verify its effectiveness.\\n\\n1.6 - more_info\\nthe document provides detailed information on sql statistics in the current environment, including top 10 sql statements sorted by total execution time, average execution time, and execution frequency. it also provides examples of sql statements. the document further explains how to collect wdr reports and their content, including database performance statistics, load profile, instance efficiency percentages, top 10 events by total wait time, host cpu usage, memory statistics, object stats, database configuration, sql statistics, and sql detail. it also provides instructions on how to download and delete tasks.\\n\\ndocument index:\\n1 -
